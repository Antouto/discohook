Here's a list of every single thing that was changed in this update.

# Meta

Discohook is now owned, operated, and maintained by @catshay. You may know me from Discohook Utils, another thing I created. Also, the entire project was completely rewritten, and is now available at https://github.com/discohook/discohook.

Naturally, Discohook and Discohook Utils have merged. [Read more about this here](discohook://guide/deprecated/migrate-utils).
