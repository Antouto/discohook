## New
- Any autocomplete menu that allows you to select a webhook will now also show the channel that the webhook is in
- The **Webhook Info** message command now has buttons to use the webhook and get its URL, just like **/webhook info**
- The **/welcomer set** command is back, enabling you to create triggers for members joining & leaving using preset flows
  - **channel** and **webhook** - only one of these is required. This sets the destination for the message.
  - **share-link** - Use a share link generated in the **Share** menu on Discohook. (looks like `https://discohook.app/?share=...`)
  - **delete-after** - Optionally delete the message after up to a minute (use 0 to remove this)
  - **/welcomer view** - Check on a welcomer configuration & edit the message on Discohook
  - **/welcomer delete** - Delete a welcomer
- When selecting a webhook from your server, Discohook will now show you the channel that the webhook is in - especially useful if you have multiple similarly-named webhooks
- There is now a link to edit the backup selected in send message actions

## Fixed
- Fixed old link buttons sometimes refusing updates and deletions from within Discord
- Fixed the site sometimes ignoring message threads when editing components
- Fixed server channels and emojis not being loaded after creating a new webhook on the site
- Fixed confusing (but benign) errors that may have appeared after removing a webhook then attempting to edit a message
- Fixed behavior of default values when editing a message

## Updates
- Arabic is once again 100% complete (as far as content that is currently translatable) thanks to @mew610
- A Czech translation is now available courtesy of @playmr365_
