# Positioning

Message components like buttons and select menus are contained in what's called an action row. Each message can have up to 5 action rows. The maximum "width" of an action row is 5 units.

- Button: 1 unit wide (5 per row)
- Select Menu: 5 units wide (1 per row)

If you are positioning a component vertically among several rows, you may notice it skip a row. This is because Discohook automatically avoids overfilling action rows. If you want to place a component in a row that has already reached its maximum width, you will first need to remove some components to make room.
