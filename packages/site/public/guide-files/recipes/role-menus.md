# Role Menus

Here's how to create role menus using components & flows.

## Buttons

A simple button role setup with a response can be created with the following actions:

1. Toggle role
 - If you want the role to be add-only or remove-only, just choose "Add role" or "Remove role" instead
 - If you only want to allow the user to 
2. Stop
 - Provide "Content" with your message, which will be seen by the person who pressed the button
 - You will likely want to make the message hidden (select "Hidden (ephemeral)" in the "Flags" dropdown)
